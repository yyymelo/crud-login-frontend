            <p>the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Tennessee College of Medicine,
                Seddon was awarded her doctor of medicine degree in 1973. During her residency with the
                University of Tennessee hospitals, she was the only woman in the General Surgery Residency
                Program. Before, during and after her career in the astronaut program, she worked in hospital
                emergency departments. She retired from NASA in November 1997 and became Chief Medical Officer
                of the Vanderbilt Medical Group </p>
            <p>The Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album was an honor presented at the Grammy Awards
                , a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards,
                to recording artists for quality works on albums in the contemporary R&B music genre.
                The award for Best Contemporary R&B Album, which recognizes R&B albums with more contemporary
                musical stylings, was first presented to Ashanti at the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003 for her
                self-titled debut album.</p>
            <p>According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award was reserved for
                albums "containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded contemporary R&B vocal tracks"
                which may also "incorporate production elements found in rap music". Beyoncé (pictured) holds the
                record for the most wins, with three (all of her first three solo albums earned her the award).
                Usher is the only other artist to receive the award more than once. From 2012, this category was
                discontinued as part of a major overhaul of the Grammy Award categories. Recordings in this
                category were shifted to the Best R&B Album category.</p>
